Weather Data Analysis with Python

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world weather data using Python. By leveraging libraries like pandas, the analysis uncovers trends in temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and other climate parameters across different dates. The goal is to extract actionable insights and practice core data analysis techniques in a structured workflow.
🔍 Project Highlights

- ✅ Cleaned and processed real weather datasets using **Pandas**
- 📊 Performed detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 🌡 Analyzed trends in **temperature**, **humidity**, **visibility**, and more
- 🧠 Applied logical conditions to extract weather-specific patterns
- 📅 Explored daily, monthly, and conditional weather variations

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib

📁 Dataset
The project uses a CSV file containing historical weather data. The dataset includes:

Columns include:
- `Date/Time`
- `Temp (°C)`, `Rel Hum (%)`, `Wind Speed (km/h)`
- `Visibility (km)`, `Weather` descriptions, and more


⚙️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

```bash
-git clone https://github.com/cloudysky01/weather-data-analysis.git
-cd weather-data-analysis
-jupyter notebook "Project 1.ipynb" 
```
Run each cell step by step to explore the analysis.

📊 Example Insights
-Days with the highest rainfall or snowfall
-Frequency of specific weather conditions (e.g., “Clear” vs. “Snow”)
-Monthly temperature variations
-Wind patterns during different times of the day/year

✅ Learning Outcomes
-Master data cleaning with real datasets
-Apply logical conditions and filters
-Practice grouping and aggregation with pandas
-Gain confidence in EDA workflows
